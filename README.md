# Module 15 MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze statistical information related to a new vehicle prototype MechaCar.

## Linear Regression

Based on the image below, there is a 71.5% accuracy rate of the MPG prediction.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications indicate the variance of the coils much not exceed 100 pounds per inch.  Based on the total of all lots in the image below, in combination, this is acceptable.

However, when looking at each lot individually, we can see that Lot 3 does not meet this specification.  This lot has a variance of 170.3 and fails this test.

## T - Tests on Suspension Coils

Based on the data below, the p-value of all of the lots is .06, while the only one within an evidence range is Lot 3, with a p-value of .04 and the null hypotheses should be rejected.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
In order to compare the MechaCar against the competition, using the linear regression method to compare the mpg would be the most useful.  Fuel prices are continually going up and excellent gas mileage would be of critical importance to a buyer.  Using the weight and design elements are sufficient for this study.
